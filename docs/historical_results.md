# Historical research index (Phase 2)

> **2026-10-17 current-policy notice:** This file is a historical index and contains dated references to formerly current policies (including RF-F001/RF-F002). The **active formal design constraint is RF-F003**, selected by [the registry](../data/constraints/registry.json); [design_constraints.json](../data/design_constraints.json) is a compatible mirror, not a separate authority. RF-T005 is a trial. See the [current Phase 2 status](current/phase2_status.md) and the [current Pareto result gateway](results/README.md) before interpreting any legacy numeric value as a current result. The original historical snapshot and provenance below remain unchanged.

This is an **index**, not a claim that legacy files satisfy the current RF policy. Numerical source of truth for *current* designs remains `data/design_constraints.json`. The historical snapshot below is **main at `35642be3e89f46b6ba135391cc857d76de433b92`**, immediately before PR #10; deleted files can be recovered with `git show` or GitHub's permalink.

## How to recover the original evidence

```bash
git fetch origin
git show 35642be3e89f46b6ba135391cc857d76de433b92:data/design_checkpoints.csv
git show 35642be3e89f46b6ba135391cc857d76de433b92:docs/g1_p4_sharding_validation_20261011.md

The immutable revision is also readable as `https://github.com/MasayaTakagi/reconfigurable-rf-lpf-research/blob/35642be3e89f46b6ba135391cc857d76de433b92/<path>`.

## Reference results (not interchangeable)

| Class / source at snapshot | Recorded result | Evidence status and limits |
|---|---|---|
| Current-policy LPF-007 / `candidates/LPF-007.json` (retained) | worst six-setting UL/DL IL **0.513168414 dB**, min UL H2/H3 **35.069970 / 35.069996 dB** | Finite-grid verified; optimizer did not converge; not EM-verified; fails IL ≤0.30 dB target. |
| Current-policy LPF-008 / `candidates/LPF-008.json` (retained) | IL **0.518587126 dB**, H2/H3 **35.099999 / 35.099995 dB** | Same caveats; alternative coupling layout. |
| Current-policy LPF-005/006 / `candidates/LPF-005.json`, `candidates/LPF-006.json` | IL **1.251127 / 1.163823 dB** | Local finite-grid candidates; do not meet IL target; now historical. Their independent evaluation evidence was in `experiments/no_pcb_policy_update_20261011/`. |
| Legacy CP07 / `data/design_checkpoints.csv` | IL **0.328924 dB**, H2/H3 about **35.05 dB** | **Obsolete configuration**: four independently tuned capacitances, incompatible with current maximum two tunable shunt-C branches. Not a current baseline. |
| Legacy CP09/CP10 / `data/design_checkpoints.csv` | IL **0.324314 / 0.323391 dB** | Historical PCB-coupled studies; not revalidated under all current constraints. |
| Historical theoretical CP11 / `data/independent_validation/independently_verified.json` | IL **0.295208369 dB**, H2/H3 about **35.1 dB** | k=0.98 ideal PCB-PCB coupling **exceeds current |k|≤0.6**; theory-only, not an implementable/approved reference. |
| Restricted matching-only area study / `data/matching_only_pareto_20261010.csv` | Example: at area 4, best-found chip-only IL **0.121684842 dB** | **Matching-only** objective; H2/H3 not required. Finite search; not an LPF baseline or mathematical lower bound. |
| P4-A local 15-cell pilot / `experiments/matching_limit/p4_A_checkpoint_20261011.md` | 245 eligible sampled graphs; 15 selected and independently checked with coarse grid | Incomplete/non-exhaustive pilot. One start and 3 optimizer iterations; **not** a Pareto limit or evidence P4-A is complete. |

## Current milestones and provenance

G1's **original** Actions one-/two-shard smoke and continuation were recorded as passing in [run 38128578799](https://github.com/MasayaTakagi/reconfigurable-rf-lpf-research/actions/runs/38128578799) and [run 38128871403](https://github.com/MasayaTakagi/reconfigurable-rf-lpf-research/actions/runs/38128871403). This is evidence for that historical calculation configuration, **not** a fresh P4-A run against PR #10's modified fingerprint.

PR #10 intentionally changes source fingerprints and the policy-document pointer. Resume must reject incompatible saved checkpoints; start fresh with the new configuration hash and verify artifact upload/restore on the modified head. These historical values remain comparable **only after** reconciling the circuit model, objective, fixed/variable component rules, frequency grid, and physical constraints.

This index does **not** restore old optimizer source or claim repeatable optimization from the current tree. Reproduction of a historical experiment may require checking out the above historical commit and retrieving any referenced archives/artifacts that remain available.

## Unmerged 2026-10-10 midpoint fixed shunt-C screening (matching-only, negative result)

Original source: commit [`6506e836ed3495614e1ffa447b4ad4cd01f188e7`](https://github.com/MasayaTakagi/reconfigurable-rf-lpf-research/commit/6506e836ed3495614e1ffa447b4ad4cd01f188e7) on former `experiment/matching-midpoint-cap-screen` branch, originally `experiments/matching_cost_20261010/midpoint_cap_screening.md`. This paragraph preserves the unique historical finding without reinstating a retired experiment directory.

- Question: does one additional fixed midpoint shunt capacitor improve **matching-only** six-setting UL/DL worst IL for two adjacent series LQP02 chip inductors coupled at `k=+0.4`?
- Assumptions: 50 Ω source, 60−j40 Ω fixed load, LQP02 Q=25, C Q=80; two per-setting 0–4 pF IC shunt capacitors; added fixed midpoint C scanned over 0–5 pF; each inductor 0.4–8 nH, **not catalog-verified**. Two-by-two coupled-L branch-admittance model; no H2/H3 constraints.
- Scope: five randomized SLSQP initializations and only **five passband frequency points per segment** in the search objective. The best reported maximum IL was **0.1319912168 dB** at L1≈2.83573 nH, L2≈2.83844 nH, midpoint C≈0 pF. All five solutions placed midpoint C near zero, with reported IL spanning 0.1319912168–0.1319922068 dB. Historical no-midpoint-C comparator was **0.131991212 dB** (separately checked on a 0.02 MHz grid).
- Interpretation: no benefit from this capacitor in this **restricted finite** screening. A populated GJM01 midpoint C would add 2/3 chip-area unit (from area 2 to 2⅔). The candidate was **not** independently dense-grid verified with the same grid, the optimization code/evidence are **not included** in this historical report, and **no general topology optimality, harmonic compliance, or LPF performance claim** follows. Reproduce under the current common solver before using as a quantitative comparator.
